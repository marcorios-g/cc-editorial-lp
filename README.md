 HTML/CSS practice

I Started learning frontend and wanted to create a project as practice.

This page was chosen since it was already designed by me and just wanted to put in practice the topics I learned, like HTML/CSS, flexbox and responsiveness.

I have a lot of freedom since I didn't have to worry about components and constraints.

I would love to hear your feedback about the code and what can be improved.
